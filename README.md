# node--v1-chatapp
I created this web app using socket.io
It enables multiple users in a specific group to send text messages between themselves
Users can create groups and also share links to their groups to friends so that they can join
It also has a feature to share your exact location using google map
Users in a group are notified when a user joins or leaves
This is a very basic version of a chat web app and i hope to add more features to this in the future

Below is the link to the site
